# Executive Summary

This Water Resource Inventory and Assessment (WRIA) Report for the Felsenthal National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) summarizes the results of data mining from national, regional, and local sources for information on hydrology, water rights, water availability, and water quality. This report is a compilation and summary of available and relevant information for refuge water resources within the region of hydrologic influence (RHI). Topics addressed within this report include facility information, natural setting (geology, soils, climate, hydrology, topography), and a catalog/inventory of relevant hydrologic factors (water resources, water infrastructure, water rights). Information was compiled from national and regional databases, geographically referenced to the same projection, and presented within a Geographic Information System framework.
